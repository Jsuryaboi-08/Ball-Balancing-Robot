There's a manual mode and automatic mode to get the centerpoint and radius of the disk. Default is manual

Hotkeys (Press in the actual openCV window)

# Q: Quits, also you can use the window close button in the window bar

# R: Reset disc position whilst in normal mode (not calibration or manual)

# P: toggle print output of motor force, ball angle and force multiplier

# S: toggle serial output of motor force to arduino

# C: Calibration mode, will only outline circles and do nothing else
    When in calibration mode, press c again to start regular mode (start getting the disc and then lock it and get ball position etc)
    Doesn't work in manual mode (nothing to calibrate as disc positon/radius set manually)

# M: Toggle manual mode, set the position and radius of the disc manually in the Trackbars Red window
